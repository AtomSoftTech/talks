## About
This talk goes over designing a quality PCB, from your first board to the first steps in production. 

The primary focus is a high-level discussion of critical issues that will affect all PCB designers. Along with this is a introduction to DFM, and how to decide what design issues will appy to your design when moving to a circuit board. The talk is design tool neutral, and applies to designers using any software.

Among the topics discussed:

- What to look for when selecting a design tool
- Critical design decisions, before, during, and after the design process
- Design and manufacturing terminology
- Design Rules, best practices, and Design For Manufacturing
- Common mistakes and errors to watch out for
- How to lay out schematics and PCBs to reduce errors
- How to improve PCB routing
- How to improve PCB assembly and detect errors before fabrication

The talk is roughly 1 hour in length, but the slides are intentionally verbose for later reference without a speaker.
